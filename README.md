===============================================================================

This is an introductory course to information security.  It is part of the 
[Open Security Education][1] project and is maintained by:

    [Daniel Bosk](https://github.com/dbosk/)
    
It consists of several learning modules that are linked to the repo.

It originally comes from two courses with the same name, one aimed at first 
cycle students (systems administrators to be exact) and one aimed at second 
cycle (master level) engineering students.  They differ in the level of 
technical detail and depth of coverage of the research in the area.  They are 
each maintained in a branch of this repository:

- [InfoSec in First Cycle](tree/first)
- [InfoSec in Second Cycle](tree/second)
