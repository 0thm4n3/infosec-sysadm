A Course on Information Security
===============================================================================

This is an introductory course to information security.  It is part of the 
[Open Security Education][1] project and is maintained by:

    [Daniel Bosk](https://github.com/dbosk/)
    
It consists of several learning modules that are linked to the repo.

It originally comes from two courses with the same name, one aimed at bachelors 
(systems administrators to be exact) and one aimed at master level engineering 
students.  They differ in the level of technical detail and depth of coverage 
of the research in the area.  They are each maintained in a branch of this 
repository:

- [InfoSec for Bachelors](tree/bachelors)
- [InfoSec for Masters](tree/masters)
